        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Verdis offers e-Residency, a service that provides the ability for you
          to easily register and manage a business, begin your pathway to
          citizenship, interact with a community of incoming citizens and
          business owners, receive an e-Resident card allowing you to attend
          specific Verdisian events online and in-person for free, and many
          other features.
          <br />
          <br />
          As Verdis is a young and newly founded country, your proposals,
          businesses and contributions can bring forward many potentials as the
          country continues to progress and grow.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you are a citizen, you are also automatically an e-Resident and can
          register on the <a href="https://e-residency-portal.vrdgov.org/" className="text-blue-600">e-Resident portal</a>.

        <h2 className="text-3xl mb-4">Considerations when applying</h2>
        <ul className="text-gray-600 list-disc list-inside space-y-4 pl-8">
          <li>
            <b>Background checks:</b> All applicants for Verdisian e-Residency
            will undergo background checks conducted by the Verdisian Ministry
            of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs manages the
            entirety of the application process to make sure that e-Residency is
            being applied for by a verified person with good intentions. You
            will be asked a number of security questions and be required to show
            a valid form of ID and proof of address before going forwards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Travel:</b> e-Residency status does not allow you to enter any
            foreign country, including Verdis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transparency:</b> In Verdis, a large amount of information about
            Verdisian companies is publicly available including the company
            name, registry number, legal address, contact details, names and
            surnames of representatives of the company, annual reports, paid
            taxes, taxable turnover and the number of employees in your company.
            This information being available, like many other countries, helps
            Verdis have a transparent and trusted online business environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Tax and Laws:</b> Many laws are expected to change over the next
            few years which includes changes in our laws surrounding tax. When
            these changes are announced, they will not come into action until at
            least 4 months after the announcement.
